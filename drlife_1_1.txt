       Short Description: Cellular Automata Animator v1.1
        Long Description: Also known as DrLife, this is a 1d and 2d cellular automata engine.
                          New in this version is support for Object Rexx (DrlifeO.exe).  
                          Patterns for C.A.'s can be in Life1.05, run length encoded (RLE), or ascii formats.
                          Patterns can be modified before being run, and can be selected from 
                          a file, a pattern stored as a string of 0 & 1's, or a pattern entered from the keyboard.
			  While running the pattern, you can pause and single-step the execution, or stop at a certain
			  generation. Patterns larger than 62,000 cells can be viewed in sections which are selectable
                          by marquee mouse marking the pattern graphic.
                          All Life-like rules, Binary 1d rules, and Margolus rules are supported. 
			  Cell neighborhoods of 8, 9, 4 and 5 cells are built into the program, and other
			  cell neighborhoods can be defined in a config file.
                          A number of public patterns are included.
                          Source code for use with DrDialog is included.
